Hierarchical Nesting of LDA topic models

This repository is still a work in progress

It will eventually be a place that holds the code and data for a hierarchical implementation of topic modeling.

The first steps are for me to upload the code and data for the method implemented on a century's worth of british parliamentary data. The code easily generalizes to any LDA topic models of some corpus, but here the initial code looks at 4 topic models at 4, 20, 100, and 500 topics, respectively.
